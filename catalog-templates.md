# Pipeline Catalog Templates

Pipeline Catalog Templates provide version controlled paramaterized templates for Mulitbranch and stand-alone Pipeline jobs. In this exercise we will use a Pipeline Catalog Template to create another Multibranch Pipeline project for your forked **helloworld-nodejs** repository. All you will need to do is fill in a few simple parameters and you will end up with a complete end-to-end CI/CD Pipeline for the **helloworld-nodejs** application.

## Create a Mulitbranch Project from a Pipeline Catalog Template
CasC was used to [pre-configure a Pipeline Catalog on everyone's Team Masters]() and there is a **template-jobs** folder in your Team Master named folder that has been configured (using the [CloudBees Folders Plus folder item filtering](https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/plugins/folders-plus/#folders-plus-sect-restrict)) to only allow the creation of jobs from that Catalog of templates - Node.js Multibranch....  . Now we will create a Pipeline Multibranch project for your forked copy of the **helloworld-nodejs** repository.

1. On your Team Master navigate to the **template-jobs** folder
2. Click on the Job Template in the left menu
3. Fill out the parameters
4. Click the **Save** button
