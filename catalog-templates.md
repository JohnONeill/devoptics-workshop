# Pipeline Catalog Templates

Pipeline Catalog Templates provide version controlled paramaterized templates for Mulitbranch and stand-alone Pipeline jobs. In this exercise we will use a Pipeline Catalog Template to create another Multibranch Pipeline project for your forked **helloworld-nodejs** repository. All you will need to do is fill in a few simple parameters and you will end up with a complete end-to-end CI/CD Pipeline for the **helloworld-nodejs** application.
