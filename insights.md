# DevOptics Run Insights
DevOptics Run Insights provides CD Platform monitoring and help shared services teams improve DevOps performance by exposing infrastructure inefficiencies, allowing automation constraints to be uncovered and removed. It provides you with insights into:

* Server workloads
* Job and pipeline activity
* Details of idle time - how much and when
* Number of runs waiting to start
* Length of build request queues
* Run completion and their status - successful, failed, etc.
* Optimal time for maintenance/upgrades

## Filter by Team Master
Run Insights lets you filter the shown data per master or group of masters to understand activity and performance of one or more specific masters.

* You can filter by one or multiple connected masters.
* You can remove specific masters from the filtered master list or clear all.
* It stores the filter setting in your local storage, to persist the filter when you return.
